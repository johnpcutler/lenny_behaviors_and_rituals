                            <p class="text-green-600 font-medium mb-3">This behavior likely created an initial culture of autonomy and responsibility among non-PM staff, encouraging them to take on PM duties and directly involve themselves in decision-making processes.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600 italic border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">The CEO of the company you work at now, Mercury, tweeted a few years ago where he basically was very proud of not having any product managers.</p>

                            <p class="text-green-600 font-medium mb-3">Founders being deeply involved in PM duties ensured close alignment with the company's vision and allowed them to deeply understand customer needs and product challenges before delegating responsibilities.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600 italic border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">The crux of it comes down to the founders. And the founders are your original PMs, right? And I think whenever I talk to any small seed stage company who's asking, should I hire a PM? I'm like, absolutely not. Until you cannot do the job anymore, you yourself should be the PM.</p>

                            <p class="text-green-600 font-medium mb-3">This allowed the company to handle increasing complexity and coordination needs without initially committing to full-fledged PM roles, testing the necessity and fit of such roles within their organization.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600 italic border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">...they hired, quote unquote, like these business lead titles.

                            <p class="text-green-600 font-medium mb-3">A career ladder helps to define the skills and competencies required at each level, providing a clear developmental path and motivating PMs to develop necessary skills and meet expectations.</p>

                            <p class="text-green-600 font-medium mb-3">This ensured that the teams stayed close to customer needs and pain points, allowing them to build more user-centric products and iterate based on real-time feedback.</p>
